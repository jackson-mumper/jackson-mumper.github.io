title: Spatial Twitter Analysis
---

In their spatial analysis of Twitter data, Wang and Tsou identify the network of Twitter connectivity during a 2014 wildfire in southern California. They do this by using Twitter's API to collect the tweets taken during the peak of the fire that contain keywords relating to either the disaster (i.e. 'fire' and 'wildfire') or keywords relating to affected communities (i.e. 'Bernardo' and 'San Marcos'). Once these tweets are selected, the authors filter for only tweets with geo-coordinates in their metadata. Using this as their input data, their analyses include calculating kernel density of wildfire tweet locations, text mining for important terms and phrases in the tweet data, and a social network analysis to categorize these tweets. The final products of this analysis are visual demonstrations of how twitter activity moves depending on where the fire was most active. These include bar graphs of use of location-based keywords over time and a heatmap of geo-tagged tweets during the fire. The authors also conduct a network analysis, demonstrating that the largest sources of retweets during the fire were San Diego-based news media outlets.
