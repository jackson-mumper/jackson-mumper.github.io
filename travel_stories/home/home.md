# Deciding To Go Home

I arrived in Samarkand by train from Tashkent one October afternoon. Tashkent had not treated me kindly. I spent most of my time there suffering from “-stan stomach” (the local traveler’s food poisoning). It was my first serious sickness since I had covid, and to an extent, it was a miracle my good health had lasted so long, especially given my lack of caution around tap water, street food, and stray cats. I also stayed at one of the cheapest hostels in Tashkent, which proved cramped, loud, and very Russian. Plus, Tashkent is a sprawling city with no centralized downtown, and only easily navigable by metro or taxi. The hostel was in a nice neighborhood, but was fifteen minutes from the nearest metro station. This would have been fine normally, but proved dreadful with my stomach and the October heat. And I was usually too cheap to hail a taxi.

Arriving in Samarkand, then, was a breath of fresh air. I left my stomach issues behind in Tashkent, and stayed at a nicer hostel with very friendly (at times too friendly) staff, that was an easy walking distance from most of the city’s attractions, including a five minute walk from the famous Registan. Samarkand was the most beautiful city I visited on this trip, and the Registan is one of the most stunning architectural monuments I have ever seen. It’s an elaborate complex of three blue-tiled madrasahs that served as the central location of study and trade in the Silk Road-straddling Timurid Empire. It’s the crown jewel of Uzbekistani tourism, visited by travelers from all over the world and all over Uzbekistan (it was a particularly popular destination for Uzbek weddings). I walked there for the first time after checking-in to my hostel, and was struck by the grandeur of the place. I think I spent two hours sitting on the steps outside the entrance marveling at the place. After dark, the complex lights up in an impressive show of colors and Uzbek folk music. As I sat and watched, I had a realization. “This is what I came here to do. I’ve seen what I have come here to see.”

*The Registan by day and by night*

This was, of course, not entirely true. My Central Asian bucket list still had the vanishing Aral Sea and the Turkestan mausoleum-shopping mall complex in Kazakhstan left unchecked. But it was an important step in accepting a truth that I didn’t want to face - I was ready to go home.

I arrived in Central Asia with no plan besides “travel until you can’t anymore.” From that moment, my singular goal was to make the trip last as long as possible. That meant traveling on a budget (Workaway, cheap hostels, public transit, street food) as the more money I spent, the sooner I would run out - and running out of money meant going home. It also meant spending as long as I could in each country as my visas would allow in order to cut transportation costs. But looking at a map, I realized that I was going to have to fly somewhere soon, as the next closest countries to visit by land were Russia, China, Afghanistan, Turkmenistan, and Iran (all of which were laughably terrible options in late 2022). I found a cheap flight to Bangkok so I planned to tour Southeast Asia after my visas expired in the -stans. I figured with how little I was spending, I could make my money last until May or early June 2023, rounding off a full and complete gap year.

But by the time I got to Uzbekistan, I began to realize there were several flaws in this plan:

1. **Approach to money:**
I am a cheap person already, but traveling made this habit far worse. My goal was to keep my spending to about $1000/month or $30/day. This was easy at first because I wasn’t paying for most of my accommodation. But my Uzbekistani visa only lasted 30 days, and I had a lot to see in that time. This meant that I had to hurry across the country, which in turn meant no Workaways, and therefore I started paying for housing regularly for the first time in my trip. It also meant my transportation costs increased because I was transferring cities every few days. The sudden spending increase was hugely frustrating, even though I was still, by all means, maintaining a pretty low level of spending. And despite my burn out from plov and cheap hostels, I struggled to allow myself to pay for anything more than the cheapest possible options for anything. Looking forward, I was starting to worry, only half in exaggeration, that if I didn’t change my approach to money I’d end up sleeping outside in a field in Cambodia as a last ditch effort to save money and stay a few more days before returning home - or that I'd grow too cheap to buy food and eat. My approach to budgeting had led to an unhealthy fixation with my spending habits, and I needed to change my approach if I was going to enjoy the rest of my trip at all.

2. **Difficulty of self-care:**
I think it’s pretty easy to skip self-care on a short vacation. I can put up with a lot of discomfort for a one week trip, especially when that trip is filled with activities that are more fun or fulfilling than standard self-care, and especially when I know I’ll be back to my default routines in the near future. This is harder for a long trip. By October I’d gotten pretty good at managing my daily self-care habits on the road. I knew how to seek people out when I was lonely or exit conversations when I needed introvert time. I’d learned that if I needed to be around gay people a coffee shop was usually my best bet. I was already in the habit of buying a liter of carbonated water every morning and drinking it as I started my day (and then peeing three times between 10am and noon). And I hadn't been on the road long enough for long-term self care, like doctor’s appointments, to become an issue. But anything in the middle was a challenge. Staying well-clothed was a nightmare when, by early October, every pair of pants in my suitcase was frayed or ripped, and every sock I owned was covered in holes. I knew I needed to buy more clothes, but buying clothes in a foreign country was a cultural barrier I hadn’t crossed yet. And when I eventually bought new pants for $25 in Tashkent, I spent the rest of the day upset that I’d spent away another day in Vietnam or Singapore at the end of my journey (see previous bullet point about budgeting). I also brought my favorite back-scratcher with me all around the world, but never found the time or privacy to use it. I could have prioritized this by booking a private room in a nice hotel every now and then (and that would likely have solved several other of my issues around general comfort), but again, I was being cheap. Finally, it was getting difficult to feel good socially while in the closet, and I struggled with how little depth my interactions with people generally had had. I was having the same conversation with every tourist I met (Where you from? Where have you been? What places did you like?) and with every Russian I met (How was your trip here? Do you plan to stay in Central Asia long term? Tell me about how much you dislike Putin.) and even with most of the locals I was meeting (Why are in here? Do you like Central Asia? Are you going to find a wife from my country?). I was following a script in every interaction I had with another person, and I couldn’t find a way to break that barrier.

3. **Purposelessness:**
As my rate of travel increased, I found myself in a routine of what I’d do every time I arrived in a new city. I’d check in to the hostel, and take a walk, eventually finding somewhere to eat dinner. Then the next day (Day 1), I’d take a walk to all of the city’s most important sites, pausing in the afternoon to spend a couple hours on my phone in a cafe. Day 2 I’d take a walk to all the sites I missed on Day 1. And on Day 3, I’d take a walk. Then Day 4 I’d take the train or a taxi to the next town, rinse, and repeat. After a few rounds of this, I was pretty damn bored. It’s certainly a privilege to be able to travel long-term like this, but it was getting difficult to keep going without finding ways to spice things up. The only things I could think of that would help would be finding a Tinder date (difficult already for a gay in Central Asia but particularly dangerous in Uzbekistan), or book an excursion that would cost money (see bullet point 1) and planning (see bullet point 4). After a couple weeks, I was starting to feel like a zombie. I was surrounded by beauty, but having a hard time processing it because of the sameness of my days, and because I was getting lonely from being on the move for so long.

4. **Planning burnout:**
I think this is pretty self-explanatory. I’m not someone that likes to arrive in a new place knowing nothing. I’d much rather pre-book my accommodation and research some of the attractions in the new city. This usually takes me about a day of planning. When I’m transferring cities every three days, that means I’m spending a third of my trip planning my trip. With the increased pace in Uzbekistan it felt like planning was all I was doing, which quickly became exhausting. I was tired of checking booking.com, Google reviews, and Caravanistan every two days. This meant I only had the energy to plan what was in my immediate future, and trying to organize anything more than a couple days in advance was off the table.

5. **Lack of interest in Southeast Asia:**
Before my trip, I had read a book about Kazakhstan, studied Russian for two years, listened to Kazakh music, done school projects on the Aral Sea and the Georgian breakaway states, and spent ages considering all the places to visit in the region. In contrast, I didn’t (and still don’t) know anything about Southeast Asian politics or history beyond a smidge about the Rohingya genocide and the very American narrative of the Vietnam War I learned in high school. I didn’t know names of any significant attractions in the region beyond Angkor Wat. I think this is a part of why I had such a hard time planning a trip in Southeast Asia. The main reason I visited Central Asia and the South Caucasus in the first place was due to my interest in the region, and I sought to supplement my understanding of the area with real world experience at all the places I’d learned about. That wasn’t something I could do in Southeast Asia. I didn't know enough about the region or the culture, and I didn't particularly want to learn while I was immersed in culture of somewhere else.

While I visited the Minor Mosque in Tashkent, I sat down on a step to catch my breath and check my phone, and I stumbled across [an article](https://travellemming.com/4-signs-its-time-to-go-home-from-travel/) from a travel blogger realizing he was ready to head home. The author, Nate Hake, identified four things he experienced that signified he was ready to finish his long-term travel project. To summarize, these four things were: staying longer in places, seeking out the familiar, vanishing wanderlust, getting tired of travel hassles. I related strongly to all four. I wasn’t actually staying longer anywhere - my pace had actually picked up quite a bit - but I felt I would have stayed longer in places had the Uzbekistani visa allowed. I was tired of eating plov and speaking Russian, and opting more and more to eat at Americanized restaurants and speak English, avoiding my Russian hostel-mates even though I was lonely and wanted the company. I wasn’t excited to visit Southeast Asia, even though I was leaving in barely a month. And the constant packing and repacking of my suitcase, buying bottled water everywhere, getting ripped off by taxi drivers, and the mediocrity of hostel showers were all becoming much harder to brush off as minor inconveniences. I was getting homesick. Even though these feelings had been building since I left Karakol, I tried to chalk up my homesickness in Tashkent to -stan stomach, and the increased need for comfort during times of illness. But eventually, my sickness passed, my comfort (marginally) increased, and I arrived awestruck at the Registan. But I was still lonely and tired. It was time to go home.

I rebooked my Bangkok flight to go to Denver instead, deleted my budgeting app, and decided to focus on filling my last month of travel with memories. I allowed myself to spend as liberally as I saw fit during my last month to make sure I collected as many exciting and important experiences as possible. I even booked an impromptu detour to Azerbaijan to finish off the South Caucasus and bring my final country count to double digits, and I made plans to see all my old friends and the gay bar in Almaty before I left.

I’m writing this story back at home in December, planning a trip to Mexico that is set to begin in January. I’m not sure yet if I’m rested and restored enough for this trip, but I’m working through the lessons I learned in Central Asia, and seeing how I can apply them in my new plans. Even if Mexico doesn’t pan out the way I’d like, there will always be a next trip in the future. There might be breaks along the way, but I don’t plan to stop traveling any time soon. More adventures await.
