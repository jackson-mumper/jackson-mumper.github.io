# Travel Stories

Below are some stories I've written about my travels from June-November 2022. During this time I visited ten countries: Morocco, Spain, Portugal, The Netherlands, Georgia, Armenia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan, and Azerbaijan. These stories are not written in chronological order, but they are ordered intentionally (i.e. the way I would order these stories as book chapters (no I'm not planning on writing a book)).

Many of these links are not working because I'm still in the early stages of writing. Instead, it's a list of story ideas that I'd like to write, and the few working links are the one's I've gotten around to writing. I'll update the links as I finish stories, so check back here for updates. Links that don't lead anywhere are marked in **bold** :)

*Note: if you are a potential employer who has found this page from my portfolio, please note these are private stories, intentionally left inaccessible from my main portfolio page, intended only to be shared among my friends and family. Please return to my primary portfolio page [here](https://jackson-mumper.github.io).*
