# Travel Stories

Below are some stories I've written about my travels from June-November 2022. During this time I visited ten countries: Morocco, Spain, Portugal, The Netherlands, Georgia, Armenia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan, and Azerbaijan. These stories are not written in chronological order, but they are ordered intentionally (i.e. the way I would order these stories as book chapters (no I'm not planning on writing a book)).

The list of stories below includes links to all the stories that I've finished and uploaded, and placeholder links to stories I want to write or am still drafting (unfinished projects are crossed out). Check back here for the occasional update :)
