# Queer in the Ears: Taraz Part 2


While my experience in Taraz was the most jarring encounter I had with homophobia while traveling, it wasn't the first.

The first was on a summer afternoon in Tbilisi, Georgia. As I approached my favorite park and cafe for an iced coffee with ice cream to do some writing about [ruderal gardens](https://urbanassemblage.iliauni.edu.ge/jackson-freeman-mumper-2/), I noticed a group of about 30 people gathered outside. Many of these people were carrying signs, and the group was surrounded by a rather large police presence. There had been protests and rallies all over Tbilisi since [the day I landed](https://www.euronews.com/2022/06/20/georgia-tens-of-thousands-rally-in-tbilisi-to-demand-eu-membership), so I ventured into the crowd to see what was going on. Maybe another pro-EU demonstration. I peered over the signs, most of which were written in Georgian, until I found one that I could read.

> "LGBT diplomats, keep your filthy hands off our children"

I turned around to find a different cafe.

About a week later, Diana, our internship coordinator, organized us a Saturday morning excursion to the Georgian National Museum, a grand complex of exhibits illustrating Georgian history dating back to before evolution of humankind. After spending a couple hours inside, we exited the museum and were met with a line of police officers across the city's main Rustaveli Ave. Looking past them, we saw they were overseeing a larger political gathering outside the Parliament Building that spilled out into the streets across the whole block. Curious about the commotion, me and two of the other interns made our way into the crowd to get a better look. The crowd skewed middle-aged and overwhelmingly male. One man stood on the parliamentary steps, speaking in Georgian into a microphone. The three of us watched the crowd for about 30 seconds before I found a sign in English. Written on it, the same line about LGBT diplomats and children. I turned to the girls I was with, who had begun to notice both the gender-skew of the crowd and the men gawking at their legs under their shorts. The three of us made knowing eye-contact and left.

Despite these outward displays of hostility, of all the cities I visited in the former USSR, Tbilisi was undeniably the most gay-friendly, and where I felt the most comfortable. The biggest reason for this was the support and community I had there. All three of us who stumbled into the demonstration were queer, and ARISC, the organization sponsoring our fellowship, made explicit their commitment to fostering a safe environment for us. In addition, Tbilisi has a small but very visible LGBT community. It's not uncommon of to see a rainbow flag in a window in Tbilisi, or to walk past someone wearing a pride accessory. These are definitely met with hostility, as attitudes towards LGBT rights in Georgia more generally leave much to be desired (the protest in Vake was sparked by the cafe hanging a pride flag in their window). But the queer community of the city is visible and undeniable.

After my six weeks in Georgia came to an end in late July, and I made for Central Asia, I was suddenly very alone, without queer friends or institutional support. My first stop in Central Asia was Astana, Kazakhstan's capital and second largest city, known for its striking modern architecture (the city has been built nearly from scratch over the last 30 years). In Astana, I befriended two guys, Rayim, who worked at my hostel, and Ruslan, Rayim's friend, who happened to be gay. The three of us rented a paddleboat on the river and drank [kymyz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kumis). I asked Ruslan about being gay and he told me that in Astana it really wan't a challenge these days. I was skeptical. I'd spent several hours doomscrolling through articles about discrimination, censorship, police brutality, extortion, and more in Kazakhstan's gay community. But I tried to keep an open mind - nobody writes articles about the gay people living normal lives. Ruslan came out to me very quickly after meeting me, which indicated at least some comfort in being publicly queer, and Rayim clearly didn't mind us. Rayim had to work early the next morning, and left Ruslan and me alone for the evening. Ruslam mentioned he frequented city's underground gay bar, and curious what a Kazakh gay bar would be like, I asked to go. We called a taxi to the address, and arrived to a nondescript building in an unassuming part of the city. The street was poorly lit, there was no music or people, and certainly no pride flags. From the street, it looked like any other desolate post-Soviet commie block. We walked up to the door to press the buzzer and request entry, only to realize that it was Tuesday, and they were closed. We turned around, dejected, and went our separate ways for the evening. Two days later, I left for Taraz.

*Astana*

I only encountered outspoken homophobia once after I left Taraz, at a taxi stand in Bishkek. It was late September, and I was making my way south to Jalal-Abad, with plans to see the Arslanbob walnut harvest in early October before heading to Uzbekistan. The road to Jalal-Abad was too mountainous for the marshrutkas to handle, so I instead found a taxi stand at Osh Bazaar that was sending vehicles, and paid my fare in a shared taxi. While I waited for the rest of the taxi to fill, I got to chatting with the middle-aged man directing the taxi stand. We chatted in Russian, and made our way through the standard small talk, asking me where I was going, where I learned Russian, what I thought of Kyrgyzstan. Then, without changing his friendly tone, he pointed at my ears and told me that I didn't need my earrings because people would think I was голубой - gay. My mind shot right back to Il'yas's backyard, and my heart started pounding. I tried to explain that this was normal in the US. That lots of American men, gay and straight, wear earrings and it hasn't been an indication of a man's sexuality since before I was born. But he wasn't having it, and insisted that I needed to take them out so people wouldn't think I was a homosexual. I began to feel dizzy and flustered and I walked away, and only returning to the taxi stand 30 minutes later when it was time to go. But even after 30 minutes to collect my thoughts, my anxiety was still intense. I worried about whether they somehow knew I was gay, and were secretly plotting against me. Maybe they'd deny me service to Jalal-Abad. Maybe they'd convince the whole minivan to drive me out to a desolate location and abandon or murder me there. But the taxi left with me and seven or eight Kyrgyz folks in it, as well as a very chatty Uzbek man who invited me to stay at his house in Andijon that evening (I declined). I settled into my seat and the amazing views of the lakes, valleys, and ridges of the Tian Shan passing by the window let me forget about the ordeal, and I made it safely to Jalal-Abad late that night.

Guarding my sexuality proved to be one of the most exhausting parts of traveling. I was fortunate growing up that I never had to worry about it. I first realized I wasn't straight when I was 13, and came out to my inner circles within a month. My parents have always been supportive of me, as were my friends in school. Then I went to Middlebury, a notoriously progressive liberal arts college in Vermont. Before Central Asia, the closest I'd been to a closet were the 10 weeks I spent in Uganda in 2021. But like when I was in Georgia, I spent most of my time there with American college students and under the protection of a progressive NGO that made its pro-LGBT stance quite clear. Central Asia was the first time in my life I've defaulted to presenting myself as straight, or even allowed people to make that assume that I was. I felt like an imposter quite often, knowing that people would treat me differently if they knew my sexuality. Whenever I met someone I had to risk brunting potential homophobia head-on, or protecting myself by putting up a shield. The shield kept me safe so I almost always went that route, but the shield invariably made it harder to connect with people. So many conversations one has with strangers are about family, dating, and marriage, and I couldn't participate. It was isolating allowing people to see me for something that I wasn't, and it was scary that they might still figure me out anyway.

Later that week I arrived in Arslanbob, a mountain village in ethnically-Uzbek southern Kyrgyzstan next to the world's largest walnut forest. I met Hayat, the director of the local Community Based Tourism (CBT) office, and he connected me with a homestay, and scheduled a guided tour of the forest for me the next day. I dropped my stuff off at my host family's house, and eager to move my body after a long travel day, went out on a hike to the Big Waterfall. It took me about an hour to get to the top, and after spending a brief moment watching the falls, I turned around and walked back to the homestay for dinner. On my way back I passed a group of school boys. They were very excited and curious to see a tourist, and came running up to me ask me questions. They boasted how well they spoke English (challenging phrases like "Hello" and "How are you?"), and asked me some questions in Russian to figure out who I was and what I was doing in Kyrgyzstan. I'm not very good at talking to kids, but I chatted with them for a bit, answering their questions. I'm always excited to get some Russian practice in. Then, one boy got a surprised look on his face and let out a gasp. He asked me a question I didn't understand, and I shook my head. Frustrated I wasn't getting him, he turned to charades. He pointed at me, pointed toward his ears, and asked 'почему (why)?

*Arslanbob - homestay, waterfall, and walnuts*

In retrospect, this kid seemed genuinely curious. He grew up in a remote village in Kyrgyzstan, probably with no internet access and few opportunities to leave his community, let alone to somewhere remotely cosmopolitan. One of Hayat's main goals with his CBT branch is to promote cultural awareness between his neighbors in Arslanbob and the rest of the world and he's made great strides on that front. There were maybe a dozen or so different tourists in Arlsanbob during my five-day stay there, and our host families all seemed to benefit from the extra income and English practice. But Kyrgyzstan is far from a tourist hotspot, and Arslanbob isn't even on its main backpacker route. Plus, this kid couldn't have been any older than 9. Covid had decimated tourism across the world, including in Kyrgyzstan, when we was barely old enough to start school. He might not have seen any visitors since he was 6, if ever. And would he even have remembered visitors from when he was that young? So now, here I am, a white guy with pierced ears wearing a bright red t-shirt. I look obviously different than any Central Asian man he'd met, and kids are curious people. He wanted to know more. Why was I dressed in such an outlandish way? This could have been a good moment to teach tolerance, and do my part to promote cultural awareness. I could have explained to him and his friends that in the US, men do wear earrings. And that there's nothing wrong with dressing however you want to dress. But my familiarity with this question, combined with the ear-pointing and the Russian dialogue, gave me flashbacks to Taraz and Bishkek. In a panic, I shrugged, pretended I didn't understand what he was asking, and went back to my walk.

I had dinner at my homestay that night with a lovely straight couple from the States, Iulia and Aseef, who were in the early stages of their year-long travel journey. Aseef wore one earring and a nose-ring. Curious how unique my experiences had been, I asked him if he'd encountered any hostility because of his piercings. He laughed and told me about a taxi ride he'd with an older man who was very upset by his piercings, repeatedly gesturing for him to rip them out while the other passengers grew agitated by the old man's preachiness. I realized as he talked that this experience didn't seemed to phase him. He told the story lightheartedly, as though he was recounting ordering the wrong item in a restaurant. Just another hiccup of culture shock. Maybe my anxiety wasn't just that people would think I was gay, but that they'd be correct. I told Aseef and Iulia about my earring experiences - the Taraz workaway, the Bishkek taxi stand, and the kid from that afternoon - trying, but probably failing, to maintain the same unaffected posture. The response I got was not the chuckle I had hoped for, but looks of mild concern, and Aseef asked me why, given the risks that came with being LGBT in Central Asia, I had wanted to visit at all.

*2014*

I hadn't considered this before, and I was a bit flustered when I tried to answer. But in retrospect, this question reframed how I approached my journey. I didn't want the story of my time abroad to focus on my personal struggles as a gay American, and the awful times I dealt with homophobia in this terrible place where *I'm* illegal. Shocking: a wealthy white guy travels to Asia to experience a different culture, and the culture is different than he's used to! I did my research and I knew the risks before I left. And I'm grateful I was able to take these risks and still be reasonably certain of my safety (if things got bad, I'd have just bought a flight home). After I took a moment to collect my thoughts, I told Aseef that despite the risks, I wasn't going to let my sexuality stop me from immersing myself in a place that's I've hoped to visit for nearly a decade, about as long as I've known I was gay. And as I pondered this question more over time, I realized that if I were to write off the whole region as some sort of homophobic dystopia, it would be a disservice to Ruslan and the other queer friends I'd made in Central Asia, as well as the people and organizations fighting the uphill battle to make their communities more welcoming. No culture is a monolith, and despite being broadly queerphobic, Central Asia has queer subcultures that deserve recognition.

My primary goal for travel is always to have fun and try new things. But on a multi-month adventure, I found it good to have some side quests. One of these was to get better at Russian. But as time passed and I had more experiences navigating my queerness in a the new context, I developed another side quest to spend some time around gay people and in gay spaces. This was partly a survival mechanism, but also a curiosity about what queer culture looks like in a such repressive context. Are their lives as miserable as Google searches make them out to be? How do they find each other and build community?
