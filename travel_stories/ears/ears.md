# Gay Travels Part 2: Ears


While my experience in Taraz was the most jarring encounter I had with homophobia while traveling, it wasn't the first.

The first was on a summer afternoon in Tbilisi, Georgia. As I walked up to my favorite cafe to order an iced coffee with ice cream and spend the afternoon writing about [ruderal gardens](https://urbanassemblage.iliauni.edu.ge/jackson-freeman-mumper-2/), I noticed a group of about 30 people gathered outside. Many of them were carrying signs, and they were surrounded by police. There had been protests and rallies all over Tbilisi since [the day I landed](https://www.euronews.com/2022/06/20/georgia-tens-of-thousands-rally-in-tbilisi-to-demand-eu-membership), so I ventured into the crowd to see what was going on. Maybe another pro-EU demonstration. I peered over the signs, most of which were written in Georgian, until I found one that I could read.

> "LGBT diplomats, keep your filthy hands off our children"

I turned around to find a different cafe.

About a week later, Diana, our internship coordinator, organized a Saturday morning excursion to the Georgian National Museum, a grand complex of exhibits illustrating Georgian history dating back to before evolution of humankind. After spending a couple hours inside, we exited the museum and to see a line of police officers across the city's main Rustaveli Ave. Looking past them, we saw they were overseeing a much larger political gathering outside the Parliament Building that spilled out into the streets across the whole block. Curious about the commotion, me and two of the other interns made our way into the crowd to get a better look. The crowd skewed middle-aged and overwhelmingly male. One man stood on the parliamentary steps, giving a speech in Georgian to the crowd. After about 30 seconds of looking, I found a sign in English. Written on it was the same line about LGBT diplomats and children. I turned to the girls I was with, who by now had noticed the gender-skew of the crowd and the men gawking at their legs under their shorts. The three of us made knowing eye-contact and left.

Despite these outward displays of hostility, of all the cities I visited in the former USSR, Tbilisi was probably the most gay-friendly, and certainly where I felt the most comfortable. The biggest reason for this was the support and community I had there. All three of us who stumbled into the demonstration were queer, and ARISC, the organization sponsoring our fellowship, made explicit their commitment to fostering a safe program for us. In addition, Tbilisi has a small but visible LGBT community. It's not uncommon of to see a rainbow flag in a window in Tbilisi, or to walk past someone wearing a pride accessory. The city has even tried to host pride parades, though these have [ended](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-66145898) rather [tragically](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-57720366). In my eyes, the backlash to LGBT rights is almost a sign of progress. The protest outside the cafe was sparked because they had hung a rainbow flag in their window. A reactionary counterprotest would be unnecessary if it weren't for the shifts happening in public acceptance of LGBT people and support for LGBT rights. So while it's upsetting to see so much violence toward the LGBT community as is in Tbilisi, one thing that everyone can agree on in Tbilisi is that gay people exist, and are a force of change.

After my six weeks in Georgia came to an end in late July, and I made for Central Asia, I was suddenly very alone, without queer friends or institutional support, and in a political context where queer rights are much more obscure than in Georgia My first stop in Central Asia was Astana, Kazakhstan's capital and second largest city, which has been built nearly from scratch over the last 30 years. In Astana, I befriended two guys, Rayim, who worked at my hostel, and Ruslan, Rayim's friend, who happened to be gay. The three of us rented a paddleboat on the river and drank kymyz (fermented mare's milk). I asked Ruslan about being gay in Astana and he told me that it really wan't a challenge these days. I was a bit skeptical of this answer. I'd spent several hours doomscrolling through articles about discrimination, censorship, police brutality, extortion, and more in Kazakhstan's gay community. But I tried to keep an open mind - nobody writes articles about gay people living happy lives. Ruslan discolsed his sexuality very soon after meeting me, which indicated at least some comfort in being publicly queer, and Rayim clearly didn't mind being the only straight person in the group (something I've found even the most liberal of straight men often struggle with). Rayim had to work early the next morning, and left Ruslan and me alone for the evening. Ruslan mentioned that he frequented city's underground gay bar, and curious what a Kazakh gay bar would be like, I asked to go. We called a taxi to the address, and arrived to a nondescript building in an unassuming part of the city. The street was poorly lit, there was no music or people, no signs of nightlife and certainly no pride flags. From the street, it looked like any other desolate post-Soviet commie block. We walked up to the door to press the buzzer and request entry, only to realize that it was Tuesday, and they were closed. We turned around, dejected, and went our separate ways for the evening. Two days later, I left for Taraz.

*Astana*

My next encounter with homophobia after I left Taraz was at a taxi stand in Bishkek. It was late September, and I was making my way south to Jalal-Abad, with plans to see the Arslanbob walnut harvest before heading to Uzbekistan. The road to Jalal-Abad was too mountainous for the marshrutkas to handle, so I instead found a taxi stand at the bazaar that was sending vehicles. I paid the fare for one seat, and got to chatting with the middle-aged man directing the taxi stand while I waited for other passengers to arrive. We chatted in Russian, and he asked all the standard questions: where I was going, where I learned Russian, what I thought of Kyrgyzstan. Then, without a change in tone, he pointed at my ears and told me that I didn't need my earrings because people would think I was голубой - gay. I was taken aback by his bluntness, and my heartrate picked up. I tried to explain that this was normal in the US. That lots of American men, gay and straight, wear earrings and it hasn't been an indication of a man's sexuality since before I was born. But he wasn't having it, and insisted that I needed to take them out so people wouldn't think I was a homosexual. After going back and forth a bit, I walked away to collect my thoughts. My anxiety was intense. I felt dizzy. I'd been transported back to Il'yas's backyard and I worried about whether the taxi director somehow knew I was gay. Maybe he was secretly plotting against me. Maybe he'd deny me service to Jalal-Abad. Maybe he'd convince the driver to drive me out to a desolate location and abandon or murder me there. I walked back to the taxi 30 minutes later, with a pit in my stomach knowing I'd have to face him again. But in the time I was gone, the other seats in the minivan had filled and it was time to go. I climbed inside and the taxi left with me and seven or eight Kyrgyz folks, as well as a very chatty Uzbek man who invited me to stay at his house in Andijon that evening (I declined). My energy with shot from the panic, but I settled into my seat and the spectacular lakes, valleys, and ridges of the Tian Shan passing by the window gradually soothed my nerves. I arrived safely in Jalal-Abad that night.

*The taxi stand guy also said that I didn't need a mustache, because it made me look 40*

Guarding my sexuality proved to be one of the most exhausting parts of traveling. I was fortunate growing up that I never had to worry about the closet. I first realized I wasn't straight when I was 13, and came out to my inner circles within a month. My parents have always been supportive of me, as were my friends in school. Then I went to Middlebury, a notoriously progressive liberal arts college in Vermont. I don't feel like myself when I'm in the closet. I'm  defensive, guarded, and scared. Even when I don't mean to hide my identity, I feel the weight of its secrecy in every interaction I have with someone who might not know I'm gay. Central Asia was the first time in my life I've defaulted to presenting myself as straight, or even allowed people to assume that I was. I felt like an imposter knowing that people would probably treat me differently if they knew my sexuality. Whenever I met someone I had to risk either brunting potential homophobia head-on, or protecting myself by putting up a shield. The shield kept me safe so I almost always went that route, but it hindered my ability to connect with people. So many conversations people have with strangers are about family, dating, and marriage, and I couldn't participate. I always felt like I was hiding a piece of myself from the people I met, who welcomed me always with openness and kindness. Central Asian hospitality is unparalleled, and I felt guilty receiving this warmth while too scared or uncertain to offer any in return. And I felt guilty assuming people would be hateful in the first place. The least I could do was give people a chance to be accepting.

Later that week I arrived in Arslanbob, a mountain village in ethnically-Uzbek southern Kyrgyzstan next to the world's largest walnut forest. I met Hayat, the director of the local Community Based Tourism office. He connected me with a homestay, and scheduled a guided tour of the forest for the next day. I dropped my stuff off at my host family's house, and eager to move my body after a long travel day, I went on a hike to the Big Waterfall. It took me about an hour to get to the top, and after spending a brief moment watching the falls, I turned around and walked back to the homestay for dinner. On my descent I passed a group of school boys. They were very excited and curious to see a tourist, and came running up to me to ask questions. They showed off their impressive English skills (challenging phrases like "Hello" and "How are you?"), and asked me some questions in Russian to figure out who I was and what I was doing in Arslanbob. I'm not very good with kids, but I chatted with them for a bit, answering their questions. I'm always excited to get some Russian practice in. Then, one boy got a surprised look on his face and let out a gasp. He said something to his friends, who looked similarly surprised and they all gave me a perplexed stare. The first boy asked me a question, and I shook my head to let the crowd know I didn't understand. Frustrated I wasn't getting him, he tried charades. He pointed at me, pointed toward his ears, and asked 'почему (why)?

*Arslanbob - homestay, waterfall, and walnuts*

In retrospect, this kid seemed genuinely curious. I was probably the first man he'd ever seen with pierced ears. He grew up in a remote village in Kyrgyzstan, likely without internet access and few opportunities to leave his community, let alone to somewhere cosmopolitan. The only men with pierced ears he could have seen would be tourists like myself. But not many people are traveling to Kyrgyzstan, and despite Hayat's best efforts, few of them make it to Arslanbob. Fewer still during a pandemic that stopped tourism around the world before these kids had even started school. So now, here I am, a white guy with pierced ears wearing a bright red t-shirt and a baseball cap. I look obviously different than any Central Asian man any of them had met or seen, and kids are curious people. They wanted to know more. Why was I dressed in such an outlandish way? This could be a good moment to teach tolerance, and do my part to promote cultural awareness. I could have explained to him and his friends that in the US, men often do wear earrings. And that there's nothing wrong with wearing whatever you want to wear. But my bad experiences with talking about my earrings, combined with the ear-pointing and the Russian dialogue, gave me flashbacks to Taraz and Bishkek. In a panic, I shrugged. I pretended I didn't understand what he was asking, and walked away, leaving them behind in disappointed uncertainty.

I had dinner at my homestay that night with a lovely straight couple from the States, Iulia and Aseef, who were in the early stages of their year-long travel journey. Aseef wore one earring and a nose-ring. Curious how unique my experiences had been, I asked him if he'd encountered any hostility because of his piercings. He laughed and told me about a taxi ride he'd shared with an older man who was very upset by his piercings, repeatedly gesturing for him to rip them out while the other passengers grew agitated by the old man's volume and preachiness. I realized as he talked that this experience didn't seemed to phase him. He told the story lightheartedly, as though he was recounting ordering the wrong item in a restaurant. Just another hiccup of culture shock. Maybe my anxiety wasn't just that people would think I was gay, but that they'd be correct. I told Aseef and Iulia about my earring experiences - the Taraz workaway, the Bishkek taxi stand, and the kid from that afternoon - trying, but probably failing, to maintain the same unaffected posture. The response I got was not the chuckle I'd hoped for, but concern, and Aseef asked me why, given the risks that came with being LGBT in Central Asia, I'd decided to visit at all.

*I mean, who wouldn't want to visit here?*

I hadn't considered this before, and I was a bit flustered when I tried to answer. But in retrospect, answering this reframed how I approached my travels. I didn't want the story of my time abroad to focus on my personal struggles as a gay American, and the awful times I dealt with homophobia in this terrible place where I'm *illegal*. Shocking: affluent white guy travels to Asia to experience a different culture, and the culture is different than he's used to! I did my research and I knew the risks before I left. And I'm grateful I was able to take these risks and still be reasonably certain of my safety (if things got bad, I'd just go home). After I took a moment to collect my thoughts, I told Aseef that I wasn't going to let my sexuality stop me from exploring a place I've dreamed to visit since I gave my 7th grade presentation on Turkmenistan nearly a decade ago. That's longer than I've even known I was gay. And as I pondered this question more over time, I realized that if I were to write off the whole region as some sort of homophobic dystopia, it would be a disservice to Ruslan and the other queer Central Asian friends I'd made along the way, and the people and organizations working to make their communities more inclusive. No culture is a monolith, and despite being generally queerphobic, Central Asia has queer subcultures that deserve recognition and support.

*2014 and 2022*

My primary goals for travel are always to have fun and try new things. But on a multi-month adventure, I found it useful to have some side quests. One of these was to get better at Russian. But as time passed and I had more experiences that challenged how I view my gayness, I developed another side quest: to spend some time around gay people and in gay spaces. This was partly a survival mechanism, but also a curiosity about what queer culture looks like in a such repressive context. Are their lives as miserable as Google searches make them out to be? How do they find each other and build community?
