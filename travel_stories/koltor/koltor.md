# Hiking Woes Part 2: Kol-Tor, Kyrgyzstan

It was in late-September that I found myself in Bishkek for the second time. After my first stay in the city I went to a workaway in Karakol, helping run the social media accounts for the town’s premier backpacker hostel. But I left a little earlier than expected as the temperatures dropped, the hiking season ended, and business at the hostel slowed dramatically. I went back to Bishkek, a city I loved at first glance, to waste a few days until the start of October, when walnut harvest begins in Arslanbob, a mountain village in Southern Kyrgyzstan. But having already seen most of the Bishkek on my first visit, I had to get creative in finding ways to pass the time, which led me to organize some complicated day trips.

I saw some informational posters in my hostel about guided day tours to Kol-Tor Lake. After doing some extra research, I saw that it was a semi-popular hike, and the pictures looked beautiful. The trailhead was about 50 miles from the city, which made transportation difficult, but I read a couple reports online of solo-travelers doing the hike successfully in one day and making it back to Bishkek for dinner. Plus, I thought, I’d had mostly good experiences hitchhiking thus far, so I was sure I can figure it out. And thus, having not learned my lesson about confusing hikes in Georgia, I loaded up my daypack and set off.

Getting to the trailhead turned out to be a challenge. As it turns out, getting to a rural hiking spot in Kyrgyzstan during off-season using only public transit while barely speaking the local language is not an easy task. The trail begins about fifteen miles south of the village of Kegeti, which in turn is about thirteen miles south of the city of Tokmok. I got to Bishkek’s eastern bus station early, not knowing the official bus schedule and wanting to make sure I had plenty of extra time in case of delays. I saw there was a marshrutka going directly to Kegeti, but after asking around, I learned it didn't leave until 11. This meant I’d only arrive in Kegeti at 1, which I didn’t think would give me enough time to do the full hike and find transport back to Bishkek before dark. After a couple hours of waiting and then asking around, I finally ended up on a marshrutka to Tokmok, figuring it would get me a little closer to where I needed to go, and I could find something else there.

After two hours on the bus I arrived in Tokmok, and I immediately found a taxi driver who would take me to Kegeti for 1000 som (about $12). This seemed like a steep price compared to my other transportation costs, but in the interest of time, poor negotiation skills, and uncertainty of where to find another driver, I agreed. The driver and I chatted along the drive, and I told him I was going to Kol-Tor and he offered to take me to the trailhead for another 1000 som. I declined.

Kegeti was a much smaller town than I anticipated, and much sleepier as well. The town’s main intersection and bus stop made some of the rural crossings where I grew up look like cosmopolitan city centers. Unsure of where or how to find another taxi, I set off on foot along the road to the trailhead. The road was long and sunny, but relatively flat. I had hoped that since I was going toward a popular hiking spot there would be a lot of traffic and I could hitchhike with relative ease. But during the first thirty minutes I walked, I was only passed by three vehicles. Each time when I heard the approaching tires I turned around and stuck out my arm to ask for a ride. Eventually, on my third attempt, a driver stopped and we were on our way.

I hopped in a pick-up truck with a fifties-looking Kyrgyz man on his way back to his ranch. We had the standard conversation I’d had in Russian a hundred times at this point about who I was, what I was doing, and how I liked Kyrgyzstan, and as we passed by a field with some livestock, he told me those were his sheep. He dropped me off at the turn toward his house and wished me luck with the rest of my journey.

My next ride came much more quickly than the first. I joined an RV with a European couple. They were one of the many European couples I met that were taking time off their careers for an extended trip across the world or at least the region. I don’t remember their exact itinerary, but it certainly included several months, lots of countries, and Iran, which I hadn’t realized was much easier for Europeans to enter than Americans. They told me they didn’t usually take hitchhikers, but that I looked both unassuming and very lost. I rode with them to the trailhead, where I waved goodbye as they parked their RV. By this point, it was already almost 1, and I knew I had to be speedy if I was going to make it back to Bishkek that night. I wondered if it would have just been faster (and cheaper) to wait for the direct marshrutka to Kegeti.

Unlike in Juta, the hike itself was largely uneventful. It began relatively flat, along a river. At first, the trail wide enough to act as a gravel road, but it gradually narrowed as I passed each of the many guesthouses on the left-hand side, though the trail was clearly marked all the way to the lake. I took comfort in knowing that there were so many guesthouses in the area in case it got dark and I needed to spend the night, until I realized they were all closed for the season (or potentially, just closed). After a while, I passed a yurt camp, the one accommodation in the area still functioning, and though I didn’t bring enough warm layers to stay in a yurt, I figured that worst case scenario, it was a better option than sleeping outside.

After the yurt camp, the trail steepened dramatically. I put on some podcasts and tried to keep a steady pace, despite my runny nose and heavy lungs. After a couple hours I made it to the top, where I saw a group of Kyrgyz tourists boating in and enjoying the waters. The view was nice. After some of the hiking in Karakol it was nothing special, and I got the sense it would have been much prettier in either the summer, with more vegetation, or winter, with a blanket of snow. But hikes are never really about the views at the top. I ate the sandwich I had packed, and headed down quickly. After a while I passed the RV couple from before who asked how far the top was. I told them it wasn’t very far. The top of the trail is never far away when you’re going back down.

It was only once I got off the mountain and returned to the trailhead that I began to worry about finding my way back to Bishkek. It was about 5pm and the sun was already starting to recede behind the mountains. And while there were several guesthouses in the area, they were all closed. I was still a long way from Kegeti, let alone Tokmok or Bishkek. I found one store that was open, and went inside to ask for help, either on how to get back to Bishkek, or if that didn’t work, for a floor to sleep on that night.

The store clerk was a friendly looking man who was quite small in height, appearing roughly nine years old. I asked him how I could get back to Bishkek. He looked at me confused and said he didn’t know. I figured that might have been too big a request, so I asked how I could get a taxi or bus to Kegeti that night. He told me there weren’t any. A little surprised and nervous, I asked if his mom was around. Maybe an adult would know more. A woman came out from behind the store and I explained my situation to her. She pointed at an empty bench next to the trailhead and said there was a marshrutka that ran to Kegeti, and that the last one of the day was in a half hour. From there, she explained, I could find a taxi to Tokmok, and that getting to Bishkek from Tokmok was easy. After the kid told me so confidently I wasn’t getting to Kegeti that night, and not having seen any buses on this stretch of road before, I was doubtful, but I went to the bus stop and waited anyway.

At around 5:45 a bus pulled up to the stop, and I asked the driver if they were going to Kegeti. They were. I got on the bus and we departed - going the opposite direction from Kegeti (I realized later that they were just dropping someone off who lived farther out, and the bus turned around soon after). The driver and the one other passenger, who appeared to be the driver’s friend, were very chatty, and I appreciated the opportunity to practice my Russian and de-stress a bit (folks in Central Asia rarely seem worried about things). They mentioned all their favorite American rappers and movies, and I embarrassingly explained my lack of American pop culture knowledge. We also talked politics for a little while, and they were astounded to know that I voted for Joe Biden. They told me he was too old, that he was losing his mind, and that it made no sense that he could be president. They didn't seem to believe me when I said he was basically the same age as Trump but much more sane. They also asked me about my ancestry, telling me that I looked Spanish. When I later mentioned I spoke Spanish, they assumed it was because I had a Spanish grandparent or distant relative. They were surprised to learn I did not.

When we got to Kegeti they helped me find and negotiate a taxi to Tokmok. This time the cost was 80 som per seat, or 240 som for a private ride. I opted for the 240, and the driver was shocked when I told him what I’d paid for my last trip. We arrived in Tokmok, and I got dropped off at the taxi stand going to Bishkek, and I got in another taxi (a shared taxi this time). I finally got back to my hostel around 8:30. And I did not do any big hikes for the rest of the trip.
