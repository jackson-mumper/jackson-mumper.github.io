# Hiking Wins: Top 5 Hikes in Georgia and Kyrgyzstan

After writing so much about the treacherous hikes I did in Juta and Kegeti, I want to balance my stories with some of the many positive hiking experiences I had this trip. I find it much easier and more fun to write about the times when things go wrong, but more often than not everything went according to plan. So I’ve compiled below a list of the five best hikes I did on my six months of travel.

## 5. Arslanbob Big Waterfall, Kyrgyzstan

Located in the mountains of Kyrgyzstan’s Fergana Valley, Arslanbob’s main claim to
fame is the walnut forest surrounding it, the largest walnut forest in the world. But any visitor to the town would be remiss to skip the town’s two main waterfalls, straightforwardly named the Big Waterfall and the Small Waterfall. Ironically, I found the Small Waterfall a more captivating site, as it is wider than its Big counterpart, and there are walkways leading directly to the pool of water at the bottom. From a hiking perspective, however, the Big Waterfall offers a better workout. A relatively major road through the town slowly morphs into the Big Waterfall trail as one goes uphill past the town’s main plaza and CBT office. Once the pavement ends, the trail is mostly flat, following a creek, but suddenly takes a sharp upward turn toward the end. The waterfall is visible the entire trail, but at the top, one looks across a deep canyon to the source of the falls, and down toward their base. It took about an hour for me to get from the town center to the top of the falls. And like most any trail near the walnut forest, the hike offers a stunning view of the town and the valley below.

## 4. Lagodekhi, Georgia

      	    </td>
            <td style="padding:10px">
            	<img src="lag2.png" width="400"/>

Lagodekhi is a situated in Georgia’s northeast corner, and were it not for the stunning
Caucasus Mountains, it would be walking distance from both Azerbaijan and Russia. I went to Lagodekhi with the other Tbilisi interns, and while our mountain hike did not take us to Russia, we joked that if we got lost we might end up there by accident. While we didn’t end up in Russia, we did end up at Ninoskhevi Waterfall, a gorgeous multi level waterfall in Lagodekhi National Park. The hike was mostly well-marked, and very popular, and the falls were beautifully tucked in the mountain, surrounded by lush green vegetation. When we arrived, there were several groups of people swimming in the pools at the waterfall’s base, including a couple engaging in far too much PDA. Unfortunately, we were pressed for time as our driver was waiting at the trailhead to take us back to Tbilisi that evening. The hike was moderate, and in addition to the waterfall had beautiful wooded sections and a pleasant creek near the beginning. Be sure to pack food; I was quite hungry on the way down.

## 3. Ala-Archa National Park, Kyrgyzstan

<div id="image-table">
    <table>
	    <tr>
    	    <td style="padding:10px">
        	    <img src="arc2.png" width="400"/>
      	    </td>
            <td style="padding:10px">
            	<img src="arc1.png" width="400"/>
            </td>
            <td style="padding:10px">
            	<img src="arc3.png" width="400"/>
            </td>
        </tr>
    </table>
</div>

Unlike Kol-Tor, Ala-Archa National Park is a day trip from Bishkek that is
well-established and easily accessible as a solo-traveler on public transit. A morning marshrutka goes directly from Osh Bazar to the park entrance, and the park is popular enough among locals in the summer that hitchhiking to the trailhead is easy (this was my first time hitchhiking and I found a car in under 20 minutes). There’s two main trails, a flat and easy riverwalk and a steeper trail leading to a waterfall and eventually a glacier. I only went to the waterfall, as the glacier is more often done as an overnight trip (although a coupleI passed on the trail insisted I was going fast enough to do the glacier in one day). Ala-Archa is very popular and thus, very well-marked, leading up through the stunning Kyrgyz Tien Shan Mountains. Even though it was still late August when I went, the leaves were already changing into a bright expanse of yellow and orange, and the mountain views were spectacular at every turn and from every angle. I was glad I skipped the glacier that trip (although I’d love to go back and see it) because it started to rain as I got off the mountain. Hitchhiking back in the rain wasn’t ideal, but I eventually got a ride from a family that worked for the US embassy, who informed me that Kyrgyzstan’s independence day was in two days. Overall a 10/10 trip.

## 2. Gergeti Trinity Church, Georgia

<div id="image-table">
    <table>
	    <tr>
    	    <td style="padding:10px">
        	    <img src="kaz1.png" width="400"/>
      	    </td>
            <td style="padding:10px">
            	<img src="kaz2.png" width="400"/>
            </td>
            <td style="padding:10px">
            	<img src="kaz3.png" width="400"/>
            </td>
        </tr>
    </table>
</div>

While it’s quite easy to find a driver to take you from the town of Stepantsminda (or
Kazbegi, I was never sure of the difference) to the famous Gergeti Trinity Church, there is also a straightforward and rewarding hike from the town to the top. The trail is quite steep, but I was able to reach the top in about 90 minutes. The trail wanders to the edge of town, then spirals around the mountain to the church and its parking lot at the top. It provides a very nice angle of scenery compared to simply driving to the top, and makes the quietude and tranquility of the church at the top much more impressive.

## 1. Ala-Kol Lake, Kyrgyzstan

<div id="image-table">
    <table>
	    <tr>
    	    <td style="padding:10px">
        	    <img src="kol1.png" width="400"/>
      	    </td>
            <td style="padding:10px">
            	<img src="kol2.png" width="400"/>
            </td>
            <td style="padding:10px">
            	<img src="kol3.png" width="400"/>
            </td>
        </tr>
    </table>

The Ala-Kol trek is the most popular trekking route in the Issyk-Kul region. It goes through mountains and valleys, over a pass, and to the high-altitude Ala-Kol Lake. It typically takes three days to complete as there are two yurt camps along the way, and from what I gathered, it was demanding. While I stayed in Karakol, I saw many groups of young, fit hikers set out on the trek with great optimism, only to return three days later disheveled and barely able to stand. But everyone raved about the experience and the views, so I knew I couldn’t leave Karakol without going.

The only issue was that I did want to do the trek. I’m not much for camping or overnight hikes, plus by September it was already getting quite cold in the mountains, and I didn’t bring proper gear. The hostel owners, Ana and K, however, told me it was possible to get to the lake and back in one day if you have a jeep to take you to the second bridge. I wrote my name, number, and interest in visiting Ala-Kol on the ‘find a travel buddy’ whiteboard in the cafe, and before long connected with a boisterous Italian man and a somewhat withdrawn Hungarian to split the cost of hiring a driver, and we were on our way.

Even though we skipped the valley that most describe as the best part of the hike, it was still magnificent. We left Karakol well before sunrise and set off on a long and rocky jeep ride (frequently bumping our heads into every part of the vehicle). From there, we hiked for several hours through woods, grasslands, boulders, and a creek, stopping often for water, to catch our breath, and admire the scenery. The trail was steep and long, and by the end it was practically rock climbing, but the view at the top of the pristine turquoise lake surrounded by black gravel peaks was serene and breathtaking (along with the altitude). This hike was a challenge, and I’m not sure if doing just the one-day version made it easier or harder, but it proved hugely rewarding and immensely beautiful.


Looking back, it seems I did all my hiking in only two countries. Nonetheless, for any hiking lovers, Georgia and Kyrgyzstan both offer some of the most incredible mountain hikes and vistas I’ve ever seen, and I can not recommend them enough. Just go in a group, try not to lose the trail, and take a sleeping bag just in case things go wrong.
