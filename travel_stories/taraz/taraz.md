# Taraz

One of the main tools I used to plan my trip was Workaway. For those unfamiliar, workaway.info is a site that connects hosts and travelers from around the world for work exchanges. Hosts list their projects or businesses on the Workaway platform, and travelers (workawayers) can reach out to hosts to volunteer part time work in exchange for accommodation. There are lots of Workaway options for those traveling to prime destinations in Europe, Latin America, Southeast Asia, etc. In Central Asia, the options are much more limited. I did three Workaways during my time there, but the first was by far the most memorable.

Located in the city of Taraz in southern Kazakhstan, this experience was billed under a very typical Workaway formula - part-time work at a hostel in exchange for a free bed in the hostel. I knew very little about Kazakhstan’s sixth biggest city before my arrival, and I thought this would be a great opportunity to explore an off-the-beaten-path region in my already off-the-beaten-path destination. I sent the host a message.

Il’yas replied very quickly to my message asking to set up a WhatsApp video call. Our first call was very short, disrupted by an unstable internet connection. But our second call was successful. Il’yas was joined by his cousin Yasbol, and the two explained that while the tourism industry was still suffering from the pandemic, they were expecting a summer boom as pandemic restrictions eased. Instead of working at the hostel, however, they were building a “thematical park” to showcase traditional Kazakh knives and weaponry. They gave me a WhatsApp tour of their workshop and asked if this was something I’d be interested in working on. Nervously, having not been expecting knives and weaponry, but curious to see what adventures lie ahead, I agreed.

*Taraz*

I arrived in Taraz after an 18-hour overnight train ride from Astana through the Kazakh steppe in early August, excited for what my coming three week Workaway had in store. I got off the train and called Il’yas, who got out of his car to greet me as I exited the train station. He looked to be in his mid-thirties, a few inches taller than me, wearing a blue and purple striped t-shirt and khaki shorts. He was driven by his friend Ruslan, and the three of us drove back to Il’yas’s house, where he showed me the couch I’d be staying on. I dropped off my things and met them in the backyard, and as we got to know each other, Ilyas asked for my Instagram. I showed him my account, and a few moments later he placed his phone back in front of me, zooming in on an obscure corner of one of my pictures to ask a question. “What flag is this?”

The picture in question was of me receiving my diploma at graduation, and the flag was the rainbow located across the stole I received at the lavender graduation ceremony a few days before commencement, celebrating the accomplishments of Middlebury’s LGBT graduates.

“Is this LGBT?” he asked again. Having just met Il’yas, I wasn’t sure how honest I could be about my sexuality with him. But given the reputation of queer rights in Central Asia, I decided to play it safe and tell half the truth. I told him that it was LGBT, and I received it for the work I did with my college’s LGBT organizations (I attended three meetings during my four years at Middlebury).

“But you are normal?” he pressed, looking for confirmation. Normally, I don’t like lying, but still unsure and made uncomfortable by the situation, I nodded my head. I suppose it wasn’t technically a lie - it is perfectly normal to be gay - but it was clear that to him, “normal” meant straight. Seemingly satisfied with my answer, he added “Good. We hate LGBT.”

*Jackson was, in fact, extremely gay*

In a slight panic that afternoon, I conducted a thorough cleaning of my social media profiles. I removed my sexuality from my Facebook page, privated my Instagram profile, archived some old photos of my ex and I, and unfollowed the network of Almaty gay bars and activists I had researched on the off chance someone in Taraz would recognize the names. Still, I decided from that moment on I was not going to add anyone I met in Central Asia on social media unless I knew they were queer-friendly, or unless I had already left their city.

That afternoon, the three of us walked a few blocks over and Il’yas gave me a tour of the knife-making workshop. Ruslan spoke very little English, so I tried to chat with him in Russian, but he didn’t seem chatty. Halfway through the tour the two of them stopped and sat around a large empty water bottle that had been cut into a makeshift bong. They offered me to take a hit, but I declined, unsure about smoking while surrounded by heavy machinery and knives. The two shrugged and smoked anyway. Il’yas told me that just east of Taraz in the Fields of Chu is one of the largest natural marijuana fields in the world. He spoke of this place with a great sense of wonder. After they smoked, we went back outside and Il’yas showed me the guesthouse he used to run next door, which currently lay vacant. Kazakhstan is not a widely visited country by outsiders, and Taraz is not a widely visited city even by Kazakh standards. Add in the ripple effects of a pandemic, and a guesthouse is not a very viable business.

Even still, Il’yas was very passionate about his city, and committed to helping it fulfill its touristic potential. He studied tourism and hospitality at Nazarbayev University in Astana and taught human geography for a while (we bonded over this shared interest). He felt deeply connected to his country and history. In addition to the guesthouse and thematical park (which he was still building), he was a documentary filmmaker. He showed me a short film he had made before the pandemic about a group of workawayers he had hosted from several different countries around the world, and the cultural experience they had in Kazakhstan. I recognized a couple of faces from reviews left on Il’yas’s Workaway profile. The video showed them trying camel’s milk, riding horses, and doing a photoshoot at a junkyard at sunset in the vast Kazakh steppe. The film was incredibly well produced. There was Kazakh folk music, beautiful cinematography, and great characterization. He told me it had won him awards at a few international competitions, and I believed him. I got to the end of the film and felt like I knew each of the people in it well.

As we watched, Il’yas pointed out one of the characters to me -  a blond, curly haired guy in his mid twenties from somewhere in Europe, I think France. Il’yas told me that when he arrived, he was a vegetarian. Central Asian cuisine, however, is very meat heavy, and local delicacies often include meats that people from the west find off-putting, like horse. But in Kazakhstan, this French guy gave up vegetarianism in order to be more immersed in the local culture. One of the first scenes in the film showed him visibly uncomfortable in a meat market, and one of the last scenes showed him slaughtering a chicken for dinner. Il’yas was very proud of him, of how he had set aside his own cultural background to be fully immersed in the Kazakh way of life, and also seemed proud of himself for fostering this transformation.

Il’yas told me his great plan for my time with him (I wasn’t sure what happened to the thematical park). I would be the hero in my own movie. The film would depict me arriving in Kazakhstan, uncomfortable and unsure of my new surroundings, and we would go to the Fields of Chu, where I would smoke marijuana for the first time. This experience would open my mind, leading me to a spiritual awakening in which I’d learn to embrace the many cultural differences around me and navigate a new way of living. I told him I didn’t feel comfortable smoking weed on camera (which, despite its natural growth, is very illegal in Kazakhstan) so we came up with a new plan. Another item on Il’yas’s seemingly infinite list of projects was to create a camel riding course in the mountains, near where the thematical park was being built. Camel riding was a big part of the Silk Road trading routes, which ran right through Taraz and Southern Kazakhstan. He would take me to his plot of land, and we would survey and map the area, deciding how to go about building the track. He still had some housekeeping to do before we left, but he assured me we would depart in the coming days for our multi-night stay in the mountains
As I cozied up on the couch and went to sleep that night, the Instagram debacle from earlier was still weighing heavily on my mind, and I had the first in what would become a string of hate-related nightmares that plagued my nights in Taraz (similar to my covid nightmares in Marrakech). On one occasion Il’yas kicked me out of his house in the middle of the night after being shown my profile on a dating app. In a separate dream, I accidentally outed myself to him by mentioning a man that I found attractive, and he subsequently punched me. Like in Marrakech, these nightmares were recurrent, but unlike in Marrakech, they affected my mental health during the daytime as well. And my fears were certainly not helped by my conversations with the rotating door of Il’yas’s friends that came over for dinner.

Ilyas’s backyard dining table was a gathering space for his friend group of the thirty-somethings men in Taraz, and I was introduced to several of them. The first night in Taraz Il’yas invited his musician friend over and we had a jam session. I was given a keyboard with no working Bbs, and the friend had a guitar hooked up to a speaker. We played a little bit, but my piano skills were rusty and my knowledge of popular rock songs limited. The next day, I met Azamat, who I was informed had recently gotten out of jail. Azamat almost immediately noticed my black stud earrings and gasped, asking me why I had them. Not expecting this question or such a strong reaction, I shrugged, and replied simply that I liked them. I realized that I hadn’t seen any other men with pierced ears since I arrived in Kazakhstan. Azamat nodded and expressed respect for that decision. I liked Azamat. In a different conversation, though, Il’yas’s father asked me if I had a girlfriend. I said no, and he shook his head. Central Asians marry young, and at almost 22, while there was still time for me, I needed to start looking. He asked if I wanted to date a Kazakh girl, and I squirmed in my seat, unsure of how to respond. I didn’t want to say yes, because that felt creepy and fetishizing and untrue (not because of the Kazakh part, but because of the girl part), but I also didn’t want to say no and offend them or insinuate anything about Kazakh women - I am an opened minded person willing to date people of all races (just not women). Eventually I said I was open to it. Following this, Il’yas’s father offered to introduce me to his neighbor across the street, who had an unmarried daughter about my age. Il’yas and his friends all laughed and egged him on, insisting that I should meet this girl, which made me even more uncomfortable. I reiterated that I wasn’t interested, but when asked why I couldn’t come up with an answer and after a few long and uncomfortable minutes, the topic of conversation finally shifted elsewhere.

There wasn’t a whole lot of work for me to do while Il’yas got prepared for our mountain visit, so I mostly just followed him and Ruslan (who I was starting to think might secretly live on Il’yas’s back porch) in their daily activities. We went to Il’yas’s family farm, where a group of us smoked a joint, ate a watermelon, and harvested potatoes and fruits. The next day the crew had a funeral procession to attend, and we drove twenty minutes outside of town to pay respects, stopping on the way back to show me Aisha-Bibi mausoleum. I also spent some time taking walks around Taraz city, to escape the chaotic and masculine energy of Il’yas’s backyard. But between the nightmares, the macho posturing of middle-aged Central Asian men, and the anxiety of hiding in the closet (I have a bad record when it comes to secrets, and I don’t have much experience concealing my sexuality), I was starting to wonder if this Workaway was worth all the stress and anxiety. I really wanted to go to the mountains and plan this camel track. But the longer I stayed, the worse I felt. I started going on walks as a nice opportunity to explore the city but after a while they became a necessary escape to clear my head and feel like myself again. Then after a few days, Il’yas gave me some good news. We were leaving for the mountains the following afternoon.

*Aisha-Bibi Mausoleum, and a potato in need inspection*

I was ecstatic to hear this - it was finally time to get this Workaway started. My fears were somewhat relaxed as well, as the uncomfortable comments and conversations had all stemmed from Il’yas’s friends (Il’yas just chimed in on the laughter). Being away from Taraz seemed to be just what I needed at that moment. Plus, this would be a great way to learn about the tourism industry and Kazakh culture  - the things I came to this Workaway to do.

But my excitement was shattered by a particularly rough conversation that night. We were gathered around the backyard table getting ready for dinner as usual, and Il’yas was introducing me to another handful of his friends. This time, like what had happened before, one of his friends noticed my pierced ears. He pointed at them, and while only a few inches from my face asked me aggressively “Что это? Ты голубой?” (What is that? Are you light blue? (Light blue being Russian slang for gay men)). I defensively shook my head no, and he made a comment to Il’yas in Russian that I didn’t catch. Il’yas replied, and after a little back and forth between the two the whole group started laughing. I looked at Il’yas to ask what was being said and he replied “we just hate LGBT” laughing while shaking his head. I immediately felt a rush of anxiety swelling over me, and zoned out of the conversation. After waiting a few minutes to make sure it wasn’t clear that the comment had set me off, I went inside for some time to calm myself down. I sat on my couch in Il’yas’s dark living room, and knew I couldn’t stay here any longer.

When I went back outside, the conversation had shifted yet again. The group was talking about how wonderful cultural exchange was; how wonderful it was that I was there. The men disavowed hatred and told me they loved everyone: Muslim, Christian, atheist, man, woman, Asian, white, black, and so on. They said that racism and xenophobia were gross and wrong, and that is was a terrible thing to hate someone based on who they were. They all congratulated themselves, apparently seeing no contradictions between this talk of acceptance and their stance on LGBT. They roasted shashlyk (kebab), on an open grill, with flames stretching very close to the leaves of a neighboring tree, and celebrated late into the night.

*Пора идти - It's time to go*

When I woke up the next day, Il’yas asked if I was excited to see the mountains that afternoon. I lied and said I was. I told him I was going to go out for coffee first. He reminded me that he had instant coffee at the house, but I said I wanted a cappuccino. I went to a place I’d passed on a walk called New York Coffee. The cafe was newly built with a sleek interior, and a friendly male barista with diamond stud earring. I ordered my cappuccino and planned my next move. I was disappointed to be missing the mountains, but it was time to leave.

I arrived back at Il’yas’s house feigning distress. I told the backyard - Il’yas, Ruslan, and Azamat - that while I was gone my mom had called to inform me that my dad was in the hospital, and that I needed to go home immediately. I pretended to buy a flight home departing from Almaty the following morning, and after I packed my things, Il’yas took me to the bus station to help me find a taxi. The crew were all disappointed that I was leaving early, especially Il’yas, who informed me I was the first workawayer he’d been able to host since the pandemic, and that he had greatly missed hosting in the last couple years. He asked me a few questions about my experience - I don’t think he fully believed my story but never questioned me about it - and told me that I had to come back to Kazakhstan in the future and visit him. He suggested I get my masters at Nazarbayev University, and I said I’d consider it. And before I knew it, my four day stay in Taraz was over.

*До свидания, Тараз*

The ride back to Almaty was long and stuffy, but I eventually made it to an airport hostel Il’yas had helped me book, where I spent four hours binging TikTok on a spring bed in a dingy room as I figured out where to go next. It was still early August and I had a couple weeks left on my Kazakh visa, plus my next Workaway wasn’t scheduled until September. I booked a nicer apartment for a few days of rest in the city center, and refollowed the city’s gay bars on Instagram. My birthday was coming up soon, and I knew I needed to spend it with my people. I also needed to figure out what to do about Il’yas, who had begun texting me to see how everything was with my family. I eventually worked out a reply:

> “Hi Il’yas,

> My father is fine - thanks for checking in. The real reason I left, though, is because I felt unsafe staying with you. I actually am gay. I didn’t plan on making that known, but having to deny it, and defend myself that I’m not LGBT even though I am, was exhausting and scary.

> I hope you can find it in you to become a more welcoming and tolerant person. I can guarantee you that if your projects are successful, I won’t be the last LGBT tourist you encounter.

> Thank you for hosting me and showing me around. It was a wonderful couple of days and
I was sad to leave so soon. You’re doing really great work in Taraz. Best of luck to you.

> Jackson”

There was a whole lot more I wanted to say - that there were gay people in his city he needed to care for, that being gay is normal, that hate toward LGBT people is akin as hate based on race or religion. But I also wanted to keep it short. And not knowing the type of reply I’d get from him, I decided that ignorance was bliss. I sent the message and blocked his contact, including his number, social media, and his cousin’s number and social media just in case. The only thing I left open was the Workaway platform, which doesn’t allow users to block hosts. But I figured he knew he had a lot to lose if I gave him a negative review on the site, and he never reached out in that way.

*The bustling gay metropolis of Almaty, Kazakhstan*

After a few days of catching my breath exploring the (comparatively) much more tolerant and welcoming Almaty, I found a different Workaway on the city’s outskirts for the couple extra weeks I had before my visa expired. A guy named Jigear was looking for “art people” to work on his sci-fi cyberpunk art hub, Ynitron. We connected on WhatsApp, where his profile picture showed him holding a cat in one hand, and making a Korean finger heart with the other. I moved onto his couch the day after my birthday, and he got me ready for the sketching workshop scheduled for that evening. “Sorry if I’m a little tired today,” he mentioned as guests started rolling in for the workshop, “I spent a bit too long at gay bars last night.”
