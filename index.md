## About Me
Welcome to my GIS Portfolio! After I graduated from Middlebury College with a BA in geography in 2022, I traveled for nine months in the South Caucasus, Central Asia, and Mexico. When I got back, I worked as a geospatial data analyst at [Fraym](https://fraym.io/) for two years. I am experienced in QGIS, python, and R-studio, and passionate about applying these skills and a social science understanding in a variety of contexts, including international development, urban planning, and public health projects. I love travel, pop music, cats, and coffee shops.
