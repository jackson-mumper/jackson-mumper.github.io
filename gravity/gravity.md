*Progress Report on Gravity Model as of 7 March 2021*

*Current Status*
I have currently built two models - a hospital preprearation model and the gravity model. Both of these models function, however some tweaks are still needed and the gravity model takes >10 minutes to run. After applying these models to the netowns and New England hospitals, I have a map of catchments for New England.

*Roadblocks*
At this point I'm mostly confused about what next steps need to be taken. I'm having difficulty interpreting what is listed on the course page as instructions so there are a few areas that I'm confused about. I'm hoping that after class on Monday I have a clearer idea about what the final deliverable should be and for what purpose we have the Dartmouth HSAs.

*To-Do*
-Aggregate Hospitals in the same town/city.
-Clip data to only look at towns and hospital catchments in New England.
-Adjust my input parameters to match the Dartmouth HSAs.
-Upload to the web?
